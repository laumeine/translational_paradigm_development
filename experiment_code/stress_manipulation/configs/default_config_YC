SM_INSTRUCTION1:Instructions:
                During the following task, you will repeatedly receive unpleasant stimuli (noise + electrical stimuli).
                In each trial, either a CIRCLE, a TRIANGLE, or a SQUARE will appear. You can then stop the unpleasant stimuli.
                To do this press either the UP, RIGHT or LEFT ARROW key as quickly as possible while the shape is displayed.
                You will have to figure out for yourself which key belongs to which shape. The more often you are right and fast enough, the less you will be exposed to the unpleasant stimuli.

                To continue, press the spacebar.

SM_INSTRUCTION2:In between, you will be asked to answer some questions. Please use the RIGHT and LEFT ARROW keys and confirm your answer with the SPACEBAR.
                Please look only at your screen during the entire task.
                If you have any questions, please contact your experimenter now.

                Otherwise, you can start by pressing the spacebar.
